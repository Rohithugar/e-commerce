# Case Study: Optimizing Sales & Reducing Revenue Loss in E-Commerce
## Framework: STAR Method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

## Situation: Identifying Revenue Loss & Growth Opportunities
An e-commerce business faced challenges with high cancellation rates, returns, and underperforming cities, leading to revenue leakage. Our goal was to analyze key areas of improvement and propose data-driven strategies to increase overall revenue.

## Task: Finding Root Causes Using Data Analysis
We analyzed:
1. Order cancellations → High cancellation rates could indicate stock issues, poor customer experience, or pricing concerns.
2. Return rates → High returns suggest quality issues or misleading product descriptions.
3. City-wise performance → Some cities had low sales despite large customer bases.

## Action: Data-Driven Insights & Recommendations
## Step 1: Analyze Cancellation Rates
Objective: Find total cancellations and their revenue impact.

Total Cancelled Orders - 18,329
Revenue Loss - ₹6.92 million

## Recommendations to Reduce Cancellations:
## Improve Order Fulfillment Speed
1. Partner with multiple logistics providers for faster deliveries.
2. Implement real-time tracking and proactive issue resolution.
## Incentivize Prepaid Orders
1. Offer 5-10% discounts or cashback for prepaid payments.
2. Highlight successful prepaid deliveries to build customer trust.

## Result
By analyzing order cancellations and simulating a 20% reduction, along with a 15% increase in prepaid orders, we identified a potential revenue recovery of ₹1.88M.

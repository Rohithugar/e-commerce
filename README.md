# Case Study: Optimizing Sales & Reducing Revenue Loss in E-Commerce
## Framework: STAR Method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

## Situation: Identifying Revenue Loss & Growth Opportunities
An e-commerce business faced challenges with high cancellation rates, returns, and underperforming cities, leading to revenue leakage. Our goal was to analyze key areas of improvement and propose data-driven strategies to increase overall revenue.

## Task: Finding Root Causes Using Data Analysis
We analyzed:
1. Order cancellations → High cancellation rates could indicate stock issues, poor customer experience, or pricing concerns.
2. Return rates → High returns suggest quality issues or misleading product descriptions.
3. City-wise performance → Some cities had low sales despite large customer bases.

# Case Study: Optimizing Sales & Reducing Revenue Loss in E-Commerce
## Framework: STAR Method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

## Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: Ensure clean, structured data before analysis.
## How This Helps the Case Study
1. Ensures clean and structured data for SQL & Python analysis.
2. Highlights missing data, duplicates, and outliers before deeper analysis.
3. Provides initial business insights (best-selling products, order status trends).

## Situation: Identifying Revenue Loss & Growth Opportunities
An e-commerce business faced challenges with high cancellation rates, returns, and underperforming cities, leading to revenue leakage. Our goal was to analyze key areas of improvement and propose data-driven strategies to increase overall revenue.

## Task: Finding Root Causes Using Data Analysis
We analyzed:
1. **Order cancellations** → High cancellation rates could indicate stock issues, poor customer experience, or pricing concerns.
2. **Return rates** → High returns suggest quality issues or misleading product descriptions.
3. **City-wise performance** → Some cities had low sales despite large customer bases.

## Action: Data-Driven Insights & Recommendations
## Step 1: Analyze Cancellation Rates
Objective: Find total cancellations and their revenue impact.

**Total Cancelled Orders - 18,329**
**Revenue Loss - ₹6.92 million**

## Recommendations to Reduce Cancellations:

1. Partner with multiple logistics providers for faster deliveries.
2. Implement real-time tracking and proactive issue resolution.
## Incentivize Prepaid Orders
1. Offer 5-10% discounts or cashback for prepaid payments.
2. Highlight successful prepaid deliveries to build customer trust.

## Result
By analyzing order cancellations and simulating a **20%** reduction, along with a **15% increase** in prepaid orders, we identified a potential revenue recovery of **₹1.88M**. 

## Step 2: Reduce Return Rate
Objective: Identify return rate and simulate a **20%** reduction.
